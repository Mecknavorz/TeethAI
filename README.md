# TeethAI
Teeth AI for senior design project

## FileStuff.py
a small python file with little commands to help edit files for managing the dataset

## TeethDetection.py
the CNN used to binary classify if teeth are in the pic or not (currently empty, will fill out tommorrow)

## Test_Model and model.tflite
just some saved test models used for testing the tensorflow integration in the app

## TeethSeg.py
the teeth segmentation AI

## teeth_seg.config
Configuration file for the Teeth segmentation AI


## Other info
I've done by best to comment the code and hopefully that should give a basic description as to everything it's doing. Once this AI is trained what it should be able to do is look at a picture and tell you if teeth are visible or not, eg what Yeshwant told me to make first in order to get used to tensorflow. It's not quite there yet as there is still some set up and code I need to write first. Tonight (thurs 3/11/2021) I will do my best to finish the code to imput the data and ideally train it using the basic dataset I've created from the ODIS dataset. Then next week me and Joseph can work on implementing the code for teeth segmentation, but I'm not sure exactly how much I'll be able to do since I'm expected to do stuff with family over the break.
